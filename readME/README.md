# Build-A-Champion Workshop

Practice for the upcoming NFL fantasy season by doing mock drafts until your fingers bleed.

The NFL API is currently undergoing maintenance and the app will be back up shortly at [Build-A-Champion Workshop](https://romantic-yonath-4a367e.netlify.app/).

### Begin by inputing your league settings and your draft position

You may also just click submit to begin with standard settings

### All of the players will be listed to you in order of best to worst.

You can sort players by position and see who has already been drafted on the right side of the screen.
